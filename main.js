// 1. Basic Operations and Variables
// Create a program that asks the user for two numbers, then prints the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those two numbers.
// Concepts used: Variables, math operators, and user input.

// 2. Decision Making with If/Else
// Write a function that accepts a number as input and returns "positive" if the number is greater than zero,
// "negative" if less than zero, and "zero" if it is exactly zero.
// Concepts used: If/else statements, functions.

// 3. Switch Statements
// Create a program that takes a number between 1 and 7 from the user and prints the corresponding day of the week
// (e.g., 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, etc.).
// Concepts used: Switch statements, variables.

// 4. Arrays and Loops
// Create an array with 10 random numbers. Write a loop to find the largest number in the array.
// Concepts used: Arrays, loops.

// 5. Objects
// Create an object to represent a book with properties like title, author, and number of pages.
// Add a method to the object that returns a summary of the book in string format
// (e.g., "Title by Author is X pages long").
// Concepts used: Objects, methods.

// 6. Combined Collections and Loops
// Create an array of objects where each object represents a student with properties like name and score.
// Write a loop to print the names of all students who scored above a certain threshold (e.g., 75).
// Concepts used: Arrays, objects, loops.

// 7. Functions and Arrays
// Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an array where each number is doubled.
// Concepts used: Functions, arrays, loops.

// 8. String Manipulation
// Write a program that asks the user for a sentence and then prints the sentence with each word reversed,
// but the order of words stays the same.
// Concepts used: Strings, arrays, loops.

// 9. FizzBuzz Problem
// Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number,
// for multiples of 5 print "Buzz," and for multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz."
// Concepts used: Loops, if/else statements, math operators.

// 10. Array Methods
// Given an array of numbers, use the .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() methods to:
// 1. Double all the numbers.
// 2. Find all numbers greater than a given value.
// 3. Sum all the numbers in the array.
// Concepts used: Array methods, functions.
